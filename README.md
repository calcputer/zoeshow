## Deployment Instructions

Open http://zoeshow.herokuapp.com/#lgadmin?UNIQUEID on the tablet with video camera and http://zoeshow.herokuapp.com/#lg?UNIQUEID on the displays you want to receive video calls. Use http://zoeshow.herokuapp.com/ for non-galaxy rigs.

Click the first checkbox if you want to host a room or leave it unchecked if you want to join a room. Enter the unique room name (different from the galaxy rig name) in the text field. Check the second box if you want to send video, or leave it unchecked to receive video in that window.

Click the submit button to start/join the room.
